# Marketing Analysis & Store Sales Prediction Project 

## Overview

Welcome to the Marketing Analysis Store Sales Prediction Project repository! This project aims to delve into the fascinating world of predicting store sales using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. We explore the application of linear regression, backpropagation neural networks, and recurrent neural networks to forecast weekly sales for a specific store department.

## Description

In this project, we tackle the challenge of predicting store sales by analyzing historical sales data and relevant factors such as markdowns, temperature, and holidays. The goal is to build predictive models that can provide accurate sales forecasts for both regular and holiday weeks. By employing a combination of data preprocessing, model building, and sensitivity analysis, we aim to uncover insights into the factors influencing store sales and enhance our predictive capabilities.

## Techniques and Tools

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), autocorrelation analysis
- **Modeling:** Linear Regression, Backpropagation Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)
- **Normalization:** Min-Max Scaling
- **Data Splitting:** Train-test split
- **Validation:** Early Stopping
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## Project Phases

1. **Data Preprocessing:** We begin by exploring the dataset and identifying relevant features for analysis. Time lags and dependencies are addressed by transforming the dataset to include lagged values for sales and other variables.

2. **Linear Regression Model:** A linear regression model is built as a baseline, allowing us to understand the initial predictive performance.

3. **Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN):** A multilayer neural network with backpropagation is developed to improve prediction accuracy. The model architecture, including layers and activations, is fine-tuned for optimal results.

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** We explore the application of LSTM, a type of RNN, to capture temporal dependencies in the sales data. This model aims to capture the cyclical patterns and long-term dependencies that may exist in the data.

5. **Sensitivity Analysis:** The impact of markdowns and other factors on store sales during holiday weeks is analyzed using sensitivity analysis. This reveals which features have the most significant influence on sales.

6. **General Implementation:** A function is created to perform sensitivity analysis for any department of a specified store, enabling a comprehensive analysis across various store sections.
